### Hi there üëã
I‚Äôm a graduate student with a Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science, with a strong passion for data science, visualization analytics, and sports analytics. I‚Äôm excited about leveraging data to uncover insights and drive decision-making, especially in the dynamic field of sports. Looking forward to connecting and exploring opportunities in these areas!

üíª Projects - Computer Science
* [MarkovChain-Volleyball](https://github.com/AndreaAccornero/MarkovChain-Volleyball) : Python scripts and tools for modeling volleyball rallies using Markov chains. Includes state structuring, absorption probability calculations, and match pattern analysis based on scouting data.
* [Volley Datascience](https://github.com/dclfbk/volleydatascience) : Comprehensive toolkit for volleyball match analysis through data science. The repository includes modules for parsing scouting files, calculating custom performance indicators, applying clustering algorithms, and performing Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). It also integrates Markov chain models to analyze rally flows. The codebase is built around the [PyDataVolley](https://github.com/AndreaAccornero/pydatavolley) library and supports both open-source (NCAA) and professional datasets (Italian Serie A2, seasons 2023‚Äì2025).
* [PyDataVolley](https://github.com/AndreaAccornero/pydatavolley) : Fork of the original open-source PyDataVolley library, extended and maintained as part of my thesis. This version includes personal contributions and serves as the core library used across the other volleyball data analysis projects.
* [Music Release Year Prediction Using Audio Features](https://github.com/AndreaAccornero/DataAnalyticsProject) :This project predicts the release year of songs based on extracted audio features. It employs multiple machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks. The dataset comprises over 250,000 songs with 90+ audio features per track. Advanced techniques such as TabNet and TabTransformer are also explored to handle structured tabular data effectively.
* [Analysis of Chest X-rays for Pneumonia Detection with Neural Networks](https://github.com/AndreaAccornero/RNN_Covid19XRay) : This project focuses on analyzing chest X-rays to detect pneumonia, a potential sign of COVID-19, using neural networks. The goal is not to directly identify SARS-CoV-2 infections but to distinguish between X-rays with pneumonia and those without. Given the small size of the dataset due to privacy constraints, the project explores how different neural network parameters impact training accuracy, rather than aiming for full classification.
* [Crowdsensing-based urban mobility tracking system](https://github.com/samuele-lolli/MobilityTrackingSystem) : This project develops a location-aware, privacy-focused platform to monitor urban mobility in Bologna through crowdsensing. Using a mobile app, the system collects data on user activity, such as walking, driving, or cycling, and visualizes it in a dashboard. Privacy is protected through perturbation algorithms. The project also integrates machine learning for activity recognition and uses data clustering and heatmaps to analyze traffic patterns.
* [IoT Alarm System with Bed Presence Detection](https://github.com/AndreaAccornero/BlockChainProject) : This IoT project implements a smart alarm system that triggers only when a user is detected in bed via a pressure sensor. An ESP32 microcontroller collects sensor data and communicates it in real time using HTTP and MQTT protocols.
The system stores the data in InfluxDB and provides real-time monitoring and configuration through a web application and a Telegram bot.
* [Anti-Money Laundering in Bitcoin with Graph Neural Networks](https://github.com/AndreaAccornero/BlockChainProject) : This project explores anti-money laundering (AML) in cryptocurrency transactions, specifically focusing on classifying illicit Bitcoin transactions using Graph Neural Networks (GNN). By analyzing the Elliptic dataset, which maps Bitcoin transactions as nodes in a graph, the project investigates various GNN models, including GCN, GAT, and GraphSage, to detect illegal activities. Key graph features like centrality measures are added to enhance the model's performance.
* [Soccer Market Transfer Network Analysis (2009-2021)](https://github.com/AleTouch98/SNA_Project): This project analyzes soccer transfer market dynamics from 2009 to 2021 across the top 7 European leagues using social network analysis. Key clubs, leagues, and transfer clusters are identified through metrics like centrality and modularity, revealing influential players and financial patterns. The project provides insights into market behavior and club interactions using Python‚Äôs NetworkX library, with data from Transfermarkt.
